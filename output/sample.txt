Ingredients :
350g pack crispy potato slices
1tsp olive oil
4 Plant Chef Cumberland-style bangers
180g pack Tesco Finest sweet and fiery beetroot, sliced
1 tbsp clear honey
1 tbsp English mustard
pinch of crushed chillies
Method : 

Preheat the oven to gas 6, 200°C, fan 180°C. Place the potato slices on a baking tray and cook for 12-15 ins or until crispy. Meanwhile, heat the oil in a nonstick pan over a high heat. Add the bangers and fry for 12-14 mins, turning often, until browned and cooked through.
Remove the bangers from the pan and keep warm. Grate the beetroot directly into the pan (wear rubber gloves to prevent the juice from staining your fingers). Add the honey, mustard and crushed chillies, stir to combine, then fry for 2 mins.
Slice the bangers into small chunks and stir through the beetroot in the pan. Arrange the potatoes on a platter, then top with the beetroot and bangers mix. Scatter over sliced pickled onions and fresh parsley to serve, if you like.
